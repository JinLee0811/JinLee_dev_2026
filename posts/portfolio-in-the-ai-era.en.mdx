It’s 2026. 🌌  
Every new year, I’ve built a new portfolio website.

At first, it came from a simple thought: “Don’t developers need a portfolio?” ✍️  
But over time, it stopped being just an output  
and became **a candid record of who I was at that moment**.

## ⏱️ The time it takes to build a portfolio has been shrinking

Looking back 4–5 years ago, when I made my first portfolio site,  
it took roughly three to four weeks to finish.

Even small layout changes meant digging through CSS line by line,  
and when errors happened, I’d spend hours searching Stack Overflow.  
Fixing a tiny detail still cost a lot of energy.

Two years ago, that time was cut in half.  
About one to two weeks.  
I had a familiar stack and recurring patterns in my head.

And now. 🚀  
Building my 2026 portfolio feels entirely different.

I set the concept in Figma,  
then started implementation with Next.js and React,  
and **reached 90% completion in just one or two days**.

## ⚡ AI changed the speed of everything

At the centre of this shift is AI.

It writes code, 🤖  
explains errors,  
suggests component structure,  
and even generates design directions quickly.

Work that I would have postponed with “I’ll do it later”  
has become “I can do it right now.”

Productivity is speeding up—wildly.

## 😶 And yet, my mind isn’t at ease

Ironically, the more convenient things become,  
the more a sense of unease grows alongside them.

“If this is so easy to make,  
where does the value of what I build live?”

“In a few years,  
will even today’s development feel too slow?”

“If labour keeps shrinking,  
what will I use to prove myself?”

The future is hard to predict.  
But one thing feels clear.

Productivity will keep rising,  
and the area that machines can replace will keep expanding.

## 🧭 So what should I do?

A thought I keep coming back to is this:

**“How fast I can build” may no longer be the differentiator.**  
Instead:

- What I chose to build  
- Why I tried to solve that problem  
- What I decided, and what I gave up  
- What I learned along the way  

Maybe the real value is in being able to answer those questions.

AI can help with code,  
but it won’t choose the problems for me.  
It won’t decide the direction either.

## 📓 A record of 2026, facing a difficult era

It’s a strange time—convenience and anxiety in coexistence.

But perhaps this confusion itself  
is the reality of being a developer right now.

This portfolio and this blog  
aren’t spaces meant to provide perfect answers.

They’re just a record—  
**a trace of what I was thinking amid fast‑moving technology** ✨  
that I can return to and reflect on later.

In 2026,  
this is the kind of uncertainty I carried while building my portfolio.
