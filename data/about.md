# About

I'm a software engineer based in Sydney, Australia, focused on building production‑ready web products end‑to‑end.  
I started programming around 2022 and now have roughly two years of hands‑on experience shipping real features, maintaining existing systems, and improving codebases over time.

I recently completed a Master of IT at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and am now looking for a full‑time role in Sydney as a full‑stack developer or software engineer.

I enjoy the entire lifecycle of a product: going from a raw idea, to design and development, to deployment, and then iterating through maintenance and improvements.  
I care a lot about performance, clarity, and real user impact, and I like working on products that keep evolving rather than one‑off prototypes.

## Experience

- Software Engineer / Mentor — Elice (Remote / Korea)
  - Maintained and extended production web applications built with React, TypeScript, and Node.js.
  - Focused on improving system stability, backward compatibility, and long‑term maintainability.
  - Investigated and resolved production issues by analysing logs, APIs, and frontend–backend data flows.
  - Collaborated through GitHub pull requests, code reviews, and incremental deployments.
  - Contributed to reliability improvements through small refactors and internal documentation.

- Senior Video Producer — Youniv, Seoul (Jan 2020 – Jul 2022)
  - Led a content team that grew a YouTube channel from 100K to over 700K subscribers.
  - Applied data‑driven storytelling and audience analytics to optimise content performance.
  - Worked closely with cross‑functional partners to plan, produce, and ship high‑impact videos.
  - This experience with data, systems, and iterative improvement naturally led me to pursue software development after Youniv, where I now apply the same mindset to building products instead of videos.

## Projects

- Before You Go — AI-powered Google Maps review summarisation platform with caching and cost control
- Smart Farm Monitoring — abnormal cattle behaviour detection with ML video analysis
- AI Crop Doctor — plant disease diagnosis with real-time inference
- UniPlanner — offline-first student timetable and task manager for Windows

## Skills

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Supabase, PostgreSQL
- AI/ML: Gemini API, OpenAI API, TensorFlow
- Tooling: Vercel, GitHub, Figma

## Interests

- AI-assisted product development
- Human-friendly UX for data-heavy apps
- Building reliable systems under real constraints
- Exploring AI tooling: token efficiency, MCP, new agent patterns, and the trade‑offs between different AI models and prompting techniques (while still keeping my core software engineering fundamentals strong)
